Although the app isn't large enough to necessitate the use of useContext, implementing it to pass values instead of props was a valuable exercise. It demonstrated the benefits of using hooks for state management and improved the overall structure of the app. Also utilizing useReducer allows for better readability of event handlers since each function is its own function.
